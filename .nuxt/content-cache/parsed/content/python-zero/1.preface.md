Welcome to our Python Basic Learning Platform

This website is dedicated to teaching Python basics, primarily designed for users with no prior programming experience or those new to Python. Our content structure is inspired by the book ["Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), along with other relevant online resources.

**Website Features**:
- Concise and accessible knowledge points
- Short video introductions for each chapter
- Highlighted annotations for challenging concepts
- Interactive comment section (coming soon) for community discussions

Our goal is to provide a streamlined, user-friendly learning experience that caters to beginners while offering comprehensive Python fundamentals. Whether you're looking to start a career in programming or simply curious about Python, this platform is your ideal starting point.

Additionally, we strongly encourage using AI to assist in learning. In fact, AI can be considered the best "teacher." We recommend using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and we will provide usage tutorials in the future.

Join us on this exciting journey into the world of Python programming!
