## 1. Loops

In programming, loops are a structure that repeatedly executes a set of statements. Loops can help us simplify code and reduce repetitive work. Python has two loop structures: `while` loops and `for` loops.

### 1.1 `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a set of statements as long as the condition is true. The syntax structure of the `while` loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

In a `while` loop, the `condition` is first checked. If it is true, `statement1`, `statement2`, etc., are executed. Then the `condition` is checked again. If it is still true, `statement1`, `statement2`, etc., are executed again, and so on, until the `condition` is false, and the loop ends.

Here is a simple example of a `while` loop.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

::

In the above example, we defined a variable `i` and then used a `while` loop to print the value of `i` until the value of `i` is greater than or equal to 5. In the loop body, we first print the value of `i` and then increment the value of `i` by 1.

You may have noticed that for a `while` loop, if the loop condition is not restricted, the loop will execute indefinitely, which is called an infinite loop.

```python
# If you run the following code, the program may not end normally. In this case, you can click the stop button in the upper right corner to terminate the program, or use the shortcut key Ctrl + C to terminate the program.
while True:
    print('This is an infinite loop.')
```

An infinite loop is very dangerous because it prevents the program from ending normally and may even cause the system to crash. Therefore, when using a `while` loop, make sure that the loop condition will eventually become false to end the loop.

### 1.2 `for` Loop

In addition to the `while` loop, which requires us to actively set the loop condition, Python also provides the `for` loop, which is used to iterate over elements in a sequence (such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc.). The syntax structure of the `for` loop is as follows:

> [!Note]
> Iteration means accessing each element in the sequence one by one. For example, for a list, iteration means accessing each element in the list one by one.

```python
for element in sequence:
    statement1
    statement2
    ...
```

In a `for` loop, `sequence` is a sequence, `element` is each element in the sequence, and `statement1`, `statement2`, etc., are statements that operate on each element.

Here is a simple example of a `for` loop.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in my_list:
    print(i)
```

::

In the above example, we defined a list `my_list` and then used a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list and print the value of each element.

With the `for` loop, we can easily iterate over elements in sequences such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc., and perform specific operations, such as summing the elements in a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0
for i in my_list:
    sum = sum + i
print(sum)
```

Output:

```shell
15
```

In the above example, we defined a list `my_list` and then used a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list and add the value of each element to the variable `sum`, and finally print the value of `sum`.

Here is a simple exercise. You can use the knowledge of the `%` operator mentioned earlier and use a `for` loop to print the odd numbers in the list.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in my_list:
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)
```

::

Additionally, in a `for` loop, we can use the `range()` function to generate a sequence of integers to iterate over a range of integers. The syntax structure of the `range()` function is as follows:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

The `range()` function generates a sequence of integers from `start` to `stop`, with a step size of `step`. `start` is the starting value of the sequence, defaulting to 0; `stop` is the ending value of the sequence, but not including `stop`; `step` is the step size of the sequence, defaulting to 1.

Here is a simple example of a `for` loop using the `range()` function.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```shell
0
1
2
3
4
```

In the above example, `range(5)` generates a sequence of integers from 0 to 5, but not including 5, i.e., the sequence is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Then we use a `for` loop to iterate over this sequence and print the value of each element.

We can make the `range()` function a bit more complex, such as generating a sequence of integers from 1 to 10 with a step size of 2.

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```shell
1
3
5
7
9
```

The `range()` function is very useful when we want to execute a loop a certain number of times, such as when we want to execute a loop 5 times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print('This is the', i + 1, 'time.')
```

Output:

```shell
This is the 1 time.
This is the 2 time.
This is the 3 time.
This is the 4 time.
This is the 5 time.
```

Or when we want to iterate over the indexes of a list.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

for i in range(len(my_list)):
    print(i, my_list[i])
```

Output:

```shell
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
3 date
4 elderberry
```

In the above example, we use `range(len(my_list))` to generate a sequence of integers from 0 to `len(my_list)`, and then use a `for` loop to iterate over this sequence and print the index and value of each element.

Now, you can try combining the `range()` function and the `for` loop to print the sum of the cubes of all odd numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive).

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    sum = sum + i ** 3
print(sum)
```

### 1.3 Loop Control Statements

In loops, it is easy to encounter exceptions caused by special situations, such as infinite loops. To avoid these exceptions, Python provides some loop control statements to control the execution of loops.

- `break` statement: Used to terminate the loop. Even if the loop condition is true, it will immediately exit the loop.
- `continue` statement: Used to skip the remaining statements in the current loop and continue with the next iteration of the loop.
- `pass` statement: Used as a placeholder, indicating that nothing is done. It is usually used to occupy a code block to make the code structure complete.

Here is a simple example of the `break` statement.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
```

::

In the above example, we use a `while` loop to print the value of `i`. When the value of `i` is equal to 3, we use the `break` statement to terminate the loop. Therefore, even if the loop condition `i < 5` is satisfied, the loop will immediately exit when the value of `i` is equal to 3.

Here is a simple example of the `continue` statement.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

::

In the above example, we use a `while` loop to print the value of `i`. When the value of `i` is equal to 3, we use the `continue` statement to skip the remaining statements in the current loop and continue with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, when the value of `i` is equal to 3, the value of `i` will not be printed.

Here is a simple example of the `pass` statement.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
```

::

In the above example, we use a `while` loop to print the value of `i`. When the value of `i` is equal to 3, we use the `pass` statement to indicate that nothing is done, and then continue with the next statement. Therefore, when the value of `i` is equal to 3, there will be no change.

### 1.4 Case Study

Next, there is a simple exercise through which you can consolidate your knowledge of loops: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-6-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-6-1)

Write a Python program that accepts an integer input and then reverses this integer using both while loop and for loop.

## 2. Exception Handling

In programming, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which may cause the program to terminate. To prevent the program from terminating, we can use exception handling mechanisms to catch exceptions, allowing the program to continue executing.

In the previous examples, we mentioned that passing a non-numeric string to the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError` exception.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
number = int('abc')
print(number)
```

::

In the above example, passing a non-numeric string `'abc'` to the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError` exception, causing the program to terminate. To prevent the program from terminating, we can use `try` and `except` statements to catch exceptions.

The `try` and `except` statements allow us to catch exceptions in a block of code that may raise an exception and perform specific actions when an exception occurs. The `try` statement is used to wrap the block of code that may raise an exception, and the `except` statement is used to catch the exception and perform specific actions.

Here is a simple example of exception handling.

```python
try:
    number = int(input('Please enter a number: '))
    print(number)
except ValueError:
    print('An error occurred.')
```

In the above code, if we enter an integer, the program will execute normally and print the entered integer. However, if we enter a non-numeric string, the program will raise a `ValueError` exception. In this case, the `except ValueError:` statement will catch the exception (without terminating the program) and print `An error occurred.`.

With exception handling mechanisms, we can handle various exceptions in the program, making the program more robust. For example, we can modify the above code to prompt the user to re-enter a number if a non-numeric string is entered.

```python
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input('Please enter a number: '))
        print(number)
        break
    except ValueError:
        print('Please enter a valid number.')
```

In the above code, we use a `while True:` loop to continuously prompt the user to enter a number, and then use `try` and `except` statements to catch exceptions. If the user enters a non-numeric string, the program will print `Please enter a valid number.` and then continue to prompt the user to enter a number until a valid number is entered.
