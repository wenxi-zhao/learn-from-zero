## 1. Indexing and Slicing

### 1.1 Basic Indexing and Slicing

Similar to the list object in Python, the contents of an ndarray object in Numpy can be accessed and modified through indexing or slicing. The indexing of an ndarray object starts from 0, and elements can be accessed using square brackets `[i, j]` to access the element in the `i`-th row and `j`-th column. Here are some examples:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 4x4 array
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])

# Access the subarray from the 2nd to the 3rd row and the 2nd to the 3rd column
sub_array = a[1:3, 1:3]
print("Accessed subarray:\n", sub_array)

# Modify the subarray from the 1st to the 2nd row and the 1st to the 2nd column
a[0:2, 0:2] = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 0]])
print("Modified array:\n", a)
```

::

Similar to slicing operations on lists in Python, we can also slice ndarray objects to obtain subarrays. In slicing operations, we can use `:` to represent the entire axis, and `start:stop:step` to represent the range from `start` to `stop` (excluding the `stop` position), with a step size of `step`. Here are some examples:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2x3 ndarray
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Get the first row
first_row = arr[0, :]
print("First row:", first_row)

# Output
# First row: [1 2 3]

# Get the second column
second_column = arr[:, 1]
print("Second column:", second_column)

# Output
# Second column: [2 5]

# Get a subarray
sub_array = arr[0:2, 1:3]
print("Subarray:\n", sub_array)

# Output
# Subarray:
# [[2 3]
# [5 6]]
```

If the start and stop values are not specified, `:` represents the entire axis. In slicing operations, we can also use negative indices to count from the end of the array. For example, `-1` represents the last element of the array, `-2` represents the second-to-last element, and so on.

In slicing, we can also use `...` to represent selecting all dimensions of the array, even if the length of the selection tuple is the same as the number of dimensions of the array. For example, `arr[..., 1]` represents selecting the second column of the array, and `arr[1, ...]` represents selecting the second row of the array. For example:

Example 1: Select the second column of the array

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3x3x3 example array
arr = np.arange(27).reshape(3, 3, 3)

print("Original array:\n", arr)

example1 = arr[..., 1]
# Explanation: Select all dimensions of the array and select the second column
print("Example 1:\n", example1)
```

::

Example 2: Select the last element of the array

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3x3x3 example array
arr = np.arange(27).reshape(3, 3, 3)

print("Original array:\n", arr)

example3 = arr[..., -1]
# Explanation: Select all dimensions of the array and select the last element
print("Example 2:\n", example3)
```

::

Example 3: Select the first plane of the array

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3x3x3 example array
arr = np.arange(27).reshape(3, 3, 3)

print("Original array:\n", arr)

example4 = arr[0, ...]
# Explanation: Select the first plane of the array and select all dimensions
print("Example 3:\n", example4)
```

::

In addition to directly using the `[start:stop:step]` method for slicing, we can also use the `slice()` function to create slice objects and then use these slice objects in the array. The syntax of the `slice()` function is as follows:

```python
slice(start, stop, step)
```

Below is an example of using the `slice()` function to create slice objects:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 4x4 ndarray
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], 
                [5, 6, 7, 8], 
                [9, 10, 11, 12], 
                [13, 14, 15, 16]])

# Use the slice() function to create slice objects
first_slice = slice(1, 3)
second_slice = slice(1, 3)

# Use the slice objects to get a subarray
sub_array = arr[first_slice, second_slice]
print("Subarray created using slice() function:\n", sub_array)

# Output
# Subarray created using slice() function:
# [[ 6  7]
# [10 11]]
```

Using the `slice()` function to create slice objects allows for more flexible slicing operations on arrays. The advantages include:

- Higher readability: Using the `slice()` function can make the code more readable, especially when the slicing range is complex. By naming the slice objects, the intent of the slicing can be more clearly expressed.
- Code reusability: Slice objects can be reused, avoiding the need to repeatedly write the same slicing range in multiple places. For example, the same slice object can be used on multiple arrays.
- Flexibility: Slice objects can be dynamically created, allowing the slicing range to be adjusted based on different conditions without modifying the array access code.

### 1.2 Boolean Indexing

In Numpy, we can use boolean indexing to access elements in an array that meet specific conditions.

Boolean indexing accesses elements in an array using a boolean array, which must have the same length as the array. In boolean indexing, `True` indicates that the element is retained, and `False` indicates that the element is discarded. In simple terms, boolean indexing uses boolean operations (such as comparison operations) to obtain elements that meet specified conditions.

Below is an example of using boolean indexing to access elements in an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Create a boolean array with the condition that elements are greater than 5
bool_index = a > 5

# Use boolean indexing to access elements in the array
filtered_a = a[bool_index]
print("Elements greater than 5:", filtered_a)
```

::

In this example, we first create an array `a`, then create a boolean array `bool_index` where the elements are whether the elements in `a` are greater than 5. Finally, we use boolean indexing `a[bool_index]` to access the elements in `a` that are greater than 5.

In addition to using comparison operators, we can also use logical operators to combine multiple conditions. For example, we can use `&` for logical AND, `|` for logical OR, and `~` for logical NOT. Below is an example of using logical operators to combine multiple conditions:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Use logical operators to combine multiple conditions
# Condition: elements greater than 3 and less than 8
bool_index = (a > 3) & (a < 8)

# Use boolean indexing to access elements in the array
filtered_a = a[bool_index]
print("Elements greater than 3 and less than 8:", filtered_a)

# Condition: elements less than 3 or greater than 8
bool_index_or = (a < 3) | (a > 8)

# Use boolean indexing to access elements in the array
filtered_a_or = a[bool_index_or]
print("Elements less than 3 or greater than 8:", filtered_a_or)

# Output
# Elements greater than 3 and less than 8: [4 5 6 7]
# Elements less than 3 or greater than 8: [ 1  2  9 10]
```

### 1.3 Case Study

Through the following case exercises, we can better understand the indexing and slicing operations in Numpy.

[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-3](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-3)

Given a NumPy array `a` and a boolean array `bool_index`, please write Python code according to the following requirements:

1. Use basic indexing to access the sub-array of `a` from the 2nd to 3rd row and from the 2nd to 3rd column, and print the result.
2. Use slicing to get the first row of array `a`, and print the result.
3. Use slicing to get the second column of array `a`, and print the result.
4. Use the `...` operator to select the last element of array `a`, and print the result.
5. Use the `slice()` function to create a slice object, and use this object to access the sub-array of `a` from the 1st to 2nd row and from the 1st to 2nd column, and print the result.
6. Use boolean indexing to access all elements in array `a` that are greater than 5, and print the result.
7. Use boolean indexing and logical operators to access all elements in array `a` that are greater than 3 and less than 8, and print the result.

The definition of array `a` is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
```

## 2. Array Operations

### 2.1 Modifying Array Shapes

#### (1) Simple Array Shape Modification

In Numpy, we can change the dimensions of an array by modifying its shape. Numpy provides several methods to modify the shape of an array, with the most commonly used being the `reshape()` function.

The `reshape()` function is used to modify the shape of an array and returns a new array, while the shape of the original array remains unchanged. The syntax of the `reshape()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.reshape(a, newshape, order='C')
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to be reshaped.
- `newshape`: The new shape, which can be an integer or a tuple of integers.
- `order`: Order (optional), the style of creating the array. C row-major (row direction), F column-major (column direction), A any direction (default), K as they appear in memory.

Below is an example of using the `reshape()` function to modify the shape of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a one-dimensional array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Use the reshape() function to modify it to a 2x3 two-dimensional array
b = np.reshape(a, (2, 3))

print("Original array:")
print(a)

print("Reshaped array:")
print(b)
```

::

#### (2) Transposing Arrays

In Numpy, the `transpose()` function and the `T` attribute are commonly used to transpose arrays.

- The `transpose()` function is used to swap the dimensions of an array and returns a new array, while the shape of the original array remains unchanged.
- The `T` attribute is used to transpose an array and returns a new array, while the shape of the original array remains unchanged.

Additionally, the `rollaxis()` function and the `swapaxes()` function can be used to swap the dimensions of an array.

1. `transpose()` Function

The `transpose()` function is used to swap the dimensions of an array and returns a new array, while the shape of the original array remains unchanged. The syntax of the `transpose()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.transpose(a, axes=None)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array whose dimensions are to be swapped.
- `axes`: The new order of the dimensions. If not specified, the order of the dimensions will be reversed.

Below is an example of using the `transpose()` function to swap the dimensions of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a two-dimensional array
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Use the transpose() function to swap the dimensions of the array
b = np.transpose(a)

print("Original array:")
print(a)

print("Array with swapped dimensions:")
print(b)
```

::

2. `T` Attribute

The `T` attribute is used to transpose an array and returns a new array, while the shape of the original array remains unchanged. The syntax of the `T` attribute is as follows:

```python
numpy.ndarray.T
```

Below is an example of using the `T` attribute to transpose an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a two-dimensional array
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Use the T attribute to transpose the array
transposed_array = array.T

print("Original array:")
print(array)

print("Transposed array:")
print(transposed_array)
```

::

#### (3) Adding or Removing Array Dimensions

In Numpy, the following functions are commonly used to add or remove array dimensions:

- `expand_dims()`: Used to insert a new axis at a specified position, returning a new array.
- `squeeze()`: Used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array, returning a new array.

1. `expand_dims()` Function

The `expand_dims()` function is used to insert a new axis at a specified position, thereby expanding the dimensions of an array. This is useful when adjusting the shape of an array to match the input requirements of specific operations or functions.

```python
numpy.expand_dims(array, axis)
```

Parameter Description:

- `array`: The array in which to insert the new axis.
- `axis`: The position of the new axis.

Below is an example of using the `expand_dims()` function to insert a new axis at a specified position:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Original one-dimensional array with shape (3,)
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Original array shape:", array1.shape)
print("Original array:\n", array1)

# Use expand_dims() to insert a new axis at the first position (axis 0)
expanded_array = np.expand_dims(array1, axis=0)
print("\nShape after inserting new axis at axis 0:", expanded_array.shape)
print("Expanded array:\n", expanded_array)

# Use expand_dims() to insert a new axis at the last position (axis 1)
expanded_array_2 = np.expand_dims(array1, axis=1)
print("\nShape after inserting new axis at axis 1:", expanded_array_2.shape)
print("Expanded array:\n", expanded_array_2)
```

::

2. `squeeze()` Function

The `squeeze()` function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array, returning a new array. This is useful when dealing with arrays, such as removing unnecessary single-dimensional entries to simplify the shape of the array.

```python
numpy.squeeze(array, axis=None)
```

Parameter Description:

- `array`: The array from which to remove single-dimensional entries.
- `axis`: The axis to remove. The default is `None`, which removes all single-dimensional entries.

Below is an example of using the `squeeze()` function to remove single-dimensional entries from an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([[[[1, 2, 3, 4]],
                    [[5, 6, 7, 8]],
                    [[9, 10, 11, 12]]]])  # Shape is (1, 3, 1, 4)

# Use squeeze() to remove all single-dimensional entries
squeezed_array = np.squeeze(array1)
print("Array after removing single-dimensional entries:\n", squeezed_array)
print("Shape after removing single-dimensional entries:", squeezed_array.shape)
```

::

### 2.2 Array Concatenation and Splitting

#### (1) Concatenating Arrays

In Numpy, the `concatenate()` function is used to concatenate arrays along a specified axis, returning a new array. The syntax of the `concatenate()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.concatenate((a1, a2, ...), axis=0)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a1, a2, ...`: The arrays to be concatenated.
- `axis`: The axis along which to concatenate the arrays. The default is 0.

Below is an example of using the `concatenate()` function to concatenate arrays:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two example arrays
a1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
a2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Concatenate arrays along the first axis (rows)
concatenated_axis_0 = np.concatenate((a1, a2), axis=0)
print("Array concatenated along rows:\n", concatenated_axis_0)

# Concatenate arrays along the second axis (columns)
concatenated_axis_1 = np.concatenate((a1, a2), axis=1)
print("Array concatenated along columns:\n", concatenated_axis_1)
```

::

#### (2) Splitting Arrays

In Numpy, the `split()` function is used to split an array along a specified axis, returning a list of arrays. The syntax of the `split()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.split(array, indices_or_sections, axis=0)
```

Parameter Description:

- `array`: The array to be split.
- `indices_or_sections`: The indices at which to split the array or the number of sections to split into.
- `axis`: The axis along which to split the array. The default is 0.

Below is an example of using the `split()` function to split an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Split the array into three parts
result = np.split(array, 3)

print(result)
```

::

### 2.3 Case Study

Through the following case exercises, we can better understand array operations in Numpy.

[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-4](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-4)

Given NumPy arrays `a` and `b`, please write Python code according to the following requirements:

1. Use the `reshape()` function to reshape array `a` into a shape of `(2, 6)` and print the result.
2. Use the `transpose()` function to swap the dimensions of array `b` and print the result.
3. Use the `T` attribute to transpose array `b` and print the result.
4. Use the `expand_dims()` function to insert a new dimension at the second axis (axis 1) of array `a` and print the result.
5. Use the `squeeze()` function to remove all dimensions of size 1 from array `b` and print the result.
6. Connect arrays `a` and `b` along the first axis (rows) using the `concatenate()` function and print the result.
7. Connect arrays `a` and `b` along the second axis (columns) using the `concatenate()` function and print the result.

The definition of arrays `a` and `b` is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
b = np.array([[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]], [[5], [6]], [[7], [8]], [[9], [10]], [[11], [12]]])
```

## 3. Array Sorting

Numpy provides various sorting functions that implement different sorting algorithms. However, in most cases, we use the quicksort algorithm, i.e., the `quicksort` algorithm. Therefore, in the following sorting functions, we will not specify the sorting algorithm but use the default quicksort algorithm.

Here, we mainly introduce three commonly used sorting functions: the `sort()` function, the `argsort()` function, and the `lexsort()` function.

### 3.1 `sort()` Function

The `sort()` function is used to sort an array and returns a new array. The syntax of the `sort()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.sort(a, axis, kind=None, order=None)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to be sorted.
- `axis`: The axis along which to sort.
- `kind`: The sorting algorithm (optional). The default is `None`, which means using the quicksort algorithm.
- `order`: The fields to sort by (optional).

Below is an example of using the `sort()` function to sort an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a two-dimensional array
a = np.array([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]])

# Sort by rows
sorted_by_row = np.sort(a, axis=1)
print("Sorted by rows:\n", sorted_by_row)

# Sort by columns
sorted_by_column = np.sort(a, axis=0)
print("Sorted by columns:\n", sorted_by_column)
```

::

### 3.2 `argsort()` Function

The `argsort()` function is used to return the indices that would sort an array. The syntax of the `argsort()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.argsort(a, axis, kind=None, order=None)
```

Below is an example of using the `argsort()` function to return the indices that would sort an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a two-dimensional array
a = np.array([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]])

# Sort by rows
sorted_by_row = np.sort(a, axis=1)
print("Sorted by rows:\n", sorted_by_row)

# Return the indices that would sort by rows
argsorted_by_row = np.argsort(a, axis=1)
print("Indices that would sort by rows:\n", argsorted_by_row)

# Sort by columns
sorted_by_column = np.sort(a, axis=0)
print("Sorted by columns:\n", sorted_by_column)

# Return the indices that would sort by columns
argsorted_by_column = np.argsort(a, axis=0)
print("Indices that would sort by columns:\n", argsorted_by_column)
```

::

It is important to note that the `argsort()` function returns the indices that would sort the array, not the sorted array itself. Therefore, to get the sorted array, you need to use the returned indices to access the elements in the original array.

### 3.3 `lexsort()` Function

The `lexsort()` function is used to sort based on multiple key arrays and returns an array of indices. Generally, `lexsort()` sorts based on the last array in the `keys` parameter first, then sorts progressively forward.

```python
numpy.lexsort(keys, axis=-1)
```

Parameter Description:

- `keys`: The key arrays to sort by, usually a tuple of multiple arrays. These arrays need to have the same shape and will be sorted from the last array forward.
- `axis`: The axis along which to sort. The default is the last axis (axis=-1).

Below is an example of using the `lexsort()` function to sort multiple arrays:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data
names = np.array(['David', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])
ages = np.array([20, 25, 25, 30])
heights = np.array([180, 160, 175, 150])

# Use lexsort to sort: first by age in ascending order, then by height in ascending order if ages are the same
sorted_indices = np.lexsort((heights, ages))

# Get the sorted data based on the sorted indices
sorted_names = names[sorted_indices]
sorted_ages = ages[sorted_indices]
sorted_heights = heights[sorted_indices]

print("Sorted names:", sorted_names)
print("Sorted ages:", sorted_ages)
print("Sorted heights:", sorted_heights)
```

::

### 3.4 Case Study

Through the following case exercises, we can better understand array sorting in Numpy.

[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-5](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/numpy-for-python-5)

Given NumPy array `a` and related data, please write Python code according to the following requirements:

1. Use the `sort()` function to sort array `a` by rows and print the result.
2. Use the `sort()` function to sort array `a` by columns and print the result.
3. Use the `argsort()` function to return the indices of array `a` sorted by rows and print the result.
4. Use the `argsort()` function to return the indices of array `a` sorted by columns and print the result.
5. Use the `lexsort()` function to sort `names` based on `ages` and `heights`, in ascending order of `ages`, and if `ages` are the same, then in ascending order of `heights`, and print the sorted indices and corresponding `names`, `ages`, `heights`.

The definition of array `a` and related data is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]])
names = np.array(['David', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])
ages = np.array([20, 25, 25, 30])
heights = np.array([180, 160, 175, 150])
```

## 4. Statistical Functions

Numpy provides many statistical functions for performing statistical analysis on arrays. Here, we mainly introduce basic statistical functions, which are used to calculate the maximum, minimum, mean, median, standard deviation, etc., of an array.

### 4.1 `amin()` Function

The `amin()` function is used to calculate the minimum value of an array. The syntax of the `amin()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.amin(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, initial=<no value>, where=<no value>)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to calculate the minimum value of.
- `axis`: The axis along which to calculate the minimum value. The default is `None`, which means calculating the minimum value of the entire array.
- `out`: The array to store the result.
- `keepdims`: If `True`, the output array will have the same number of dimensions as the input array.
- `initial`: The initial value.
- `where`: The condition to calculate.

Below is an example of using the `amin()` function to calculate the minimum value of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[3, 7, 5], [8, 4, 6], [2, 9, 1]])

# Calculate the minimum value of the entire array
min_value = np.amin(array)

print("Minimum value of the array:", min_value)

# Calculate the minimum value along axis 0
min_value_axis0 = np.amin(array, axis=0)

print("Minimum value along axis 0:", min_value_axis0)

# Calculate the minimum value along axis 1
min_value_axis1 = np.amin(array, axis=1)

print("Minimum value along axis 1:", min_value_axis1)
```

::

### 4.2 `amax()` Function

The `amax()` function is used to calculate the maximum value of an array. The syntax of the `amax()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.amax(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, initial=<no value>, where=<no value>)
```

Below is an example of using the `amax()` function to calculate the maximum value of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[3, 7, 5], [8, 4, 6], [2, 9, 1]])

# Calculate the maximum value of the entire array
max_value = np.amax(array)

print("Maximum value of the array:", max_value)

# Calculate the maximum value along axis 0
max_value_axis0 = np.amax(array, axis=0)

print("Maximum value along axis 0:", max_value_axis0)

# Calculate the maximum value along axis 1
max_value_axis1 = np.amax(array, axis=1)

print("Maximum value along axis 1:", max_value_axis1)
```

### 4.3 `mean()` Function

The `mean()` function is used to calculate the mean value of an array. The syntax of the `mean()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to calculate the mean value of.
- `axis`: The axis along which to calculate the mean value. The default is `None`, which means calculating the mean value of the entire array.
- `dtype`: The data type of the output array.
- `out`: The array to store the result.
- `keepdims`: If `True`, the output array will have the same number of dimensions as the input array.

Below is an example of using the `mean()` function to calculate the mean value of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Calculate the mean value of the entire array
mean_value = np.mean(array)

print("Mean value of the array:", mean_value)

# Calculate the mean value along axis 0
mean_value_axis0 = np.mean(array, axis=0)

print("Mean value along axis 0:", mean_value_axis0)

# Calculate the mean value along axis 1
mean_value_axis1 = np.mean(array, axis=1)

print("Mean value along axis 1:", mean_value_axis1)
```

### 4.4 `median()` Function

The `median()` function is used to calculate the median value of an array. The syntax of the `median()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.median(a, axis=None, out=None, overwrite_input=False, keepdims=False)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to calculate the median value of.
- `axis`: The axis along which to calculate the median value. The default is `None`, which means calculating the median value of the entire array.
- `out`: The array to store the result.
- `overwrite_input`: If `True`, allows reusing the input array.
- `keepdims`: If `True`, the output array will have the same number of dimensions as the input array.

Below is an example of using the `median()` function to calculate the median value of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Calculate the median value of the entire array
median_value = np.median(array)

print("Median value of the array:", median_value)

# Calculate the median value along axis 0
median_value_axis0 = np.median(array, axis=0)

print("Median value along axis 0:", median_value_axis0)

# Calculate the median value along axis 1
median_value_axis1 = np.median(array, axis=1)

print("Median value along axis 1:", median_value_axis1)
```

::

### 4.5 `std()` Function

The `std()` function is used to calculate the standard deviation of an array. The syntax of the `std()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.std(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=<no value>)
```

Parameter Description:

- `a`: The array to calculate the standard deviation of.
- `axis`: The axis along which to calculate the standard deviation. The default is `None`, which means calculating the standard deviation of the entire array.
- `dtype`: The data type of the output array.
- `out`: The array to store the result.
- `ddof`: Delta degrees of freedom.
- `keepdims`: If `True`, the output array will have the same number of dimensions as the input array.

Below is an example of using the `std()` function to calculate the standard deviation of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Calculate the standard deviation of the entire array
std_value = np.std(array)

print("Standard deviation of the array:", std_value)

# Calculate the standard deviation along axis 0
std_value_axis0 = np.std(array, axis=0)

print("Standard deviation along axis 0:", std_value_axis0)

# Calculate the standard deviation along axis 1
std_value_axis1 = np.std(array, axis=1)

print("Standard deviation along axis 1:", std_value_axis1)
```

::

### 4.6 `var()` Function

The `var()` function is used to calculate the variance of an array. The syntax of the `var()` function is as follows:

```python
numpy.var(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=<no value>)
```

Below is an example of using the `var()` function to calculate the variance of an array:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Calculate the variance of the entire array
var_value = np.var(array)

print("Variance of the array:", var_value)

# Calculate the variance along axis 0
var_value_axis0 = np.var(array, axis=0)

print("Variance along axis 0:", var_value_axis0)

# Calculate the variance along axis 1
var_value_axis1 = np.var(array, axis=1)

print("Variance along axis 1:", var_value_axis1)
```
