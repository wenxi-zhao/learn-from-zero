### 1.1 Data Types

Python supports multiple data types, with the four most basic being:

- Integer: `int`, e.g., `1`, `100`, `-8080`, `0`
- Float: `float`, e.g., `1.23`, `-9.01`, `1.23e9`, `3.14e-10`
- String: `str`, e.g., `'abc'`, `'xyz'`, `'123'`
- Boolean: `bool`, including `True` and `False`

![Data Types in Python](http://szms-python-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Python%20Basics/%E6%96%B0%E7%89%88%E8%84%91%E5%9B%BE/Python%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E7%B1%BB%E5%9E%8Ben.png)

> [!Note]
> In Python, when expressing strings, you need to enclose the string content with single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`. Additionally, for multi-line strings, you can use triple single quotes `'''` or triple double quotes `"""`.

To check the data type, you can use the `type()` function:

```python
print(type(1))
print(type(1.23))
print(type('hello'))
print(type(True))
```

Output:

```shell
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'bool'>
```

### 1.2 Variables

In Python, variables are used to store data, and variable names are labels for the data. You can think of variables as boxes that hold things, with the box's name being the variable name and the contents being the data. In Python, we use `=` to assign values to variables, i.e., store the data on the right side of `=` into the variable on the left side of `=`.

```python
a = 1
b = 1.23
c = 'hello'
d = True

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
```

Output:

```shell
1
1.23
hello
True
```

When naming variables, you need to follow these rules:

- Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores `_`, and cannot start with a number.
- Variable names cannot contain spaces and cannot use Python's keywords, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, etc.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, e.g., `a` and `A` are two different variables.

Additionally, to develop good programming habits, variable names should be descriptive to understand the purpose of the variable. For example, if we want to store a person's age, we can use the variable name `age` instead of `a`.

![变量的命名规则](http://szms-python-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Python%20Basics/%E6%96%B0%E7%89%88%E8%84%91%E5%9B%BE/%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D%E8%A7%84%E5%88%99en.png)

You may have noticed that when defining variables, we are not flexible enough. For example, we want each user to enter their name and then output `Hello, xxx`. At this point, we need to use the `input()` function (functions will be introduced in detail later) to receive the user's input.

```python
input('What is your name? ')
print('Hello,')
```

Output:

```shell
What is your name?
# User enters
Hello,
```

Did you notice that we entered the name but did not output the name? This is because we did not store the user's input into a variable. We need to store the user's input into a variable and then output it.

```python
name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Hello,', name)
```

Output:

```shell
What is your name?
# User enters 'Jack'
Hello, Jack
```

Observing the above example, it is easy to see that when using the `print()` function to output, we can output multiple contents at once, just separate them with a comma `,`. In fact, besides using `,`, we can also use `+` to concatenate multiple strings.

```python
first_name = input('What is your first name? ')
last_name = input('What is your last name? ')
print('Hello,', first_name, last_name)
print('Hello, ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name)
```

Output:

```shell
What is your first name?
# User enters 'Jack'
What is your last name?
# User enters 'Smith'
Hello, Jack Smith
Hello, Jack Smith
```

### 1.3 Operators

Python supports multiple operators that can be used to manipulate various data types. First, let's look at arithmetic operators, including addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, modulus `%`, exponentiation `**`, and floor division `//`. These operators function and are used the same way as in mathematics.

```python
print(1 + 2)
```

Output:

```shell
3
```

Besides directly operating on numbers, we can also operate on variables.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print(a, '+', b, '=', c)
```

Output:

```shell
1 + 2 = 3
```

In Python, we can also use operators to modify the value of a variable. For example, if we have a variable `x` and we want to add 1 to the value of `x`, we can use `x = x + 1`.

```python
x = 1
x = x + 1
print(x)
```

Output:

```shell
2
```

In the above code, `x = x + 1` can be abbreviated as `x += 1`, which is a shorthand provided by Python. This shorthand applies to all operators, such as `x -= 1`, `x *= 1`, `x /= 1`, `x %= 1`, `x **= 1`, `x //= 1`.

The precedence of these operators is the same as in mathematics, i.e., multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. If there are multiple operators, you can use parentheses `()` to change the order of operations.

Similarly to mathematical calculations, we can use the `%` operator to determine whether a number is even or odd. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, it is even; otherwise, it is odd.

```python
x = 10
if x % 2 == 0:
    print('The number is even.')
else:
    print('The number is odd.')
```

Output:

```shell
The number is even.
```

Modifying the above program, we can create an interesting little exercise: a lazy calculator that accepts three inputs:

- Two numbers `a` and `b`
- An operator `op`, which can be `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`

The lazy calculator has some conditions:

- It can only perform calculations if both `a` and `b` are even numbers between 1 and 9; otherwise, it will complain: "This calculation is too difficult for me."

```python
a = int(input("Enter Number a: "))
b = int(input("Enter Number b: "))
operand = input("Enter operand")

if a < 1 or a > 9:
    print("This is too complicated for me")

elif operand == "+":
    print(a + b)

elif operand == "-":
    print(a - b)

elif operand == "%":
    print(a % b)

elif operand == "/":
    print(a / b)

else:
    print("Invalid operand")
```

Additionally, the addition and multiplication operators in arithmetic operations have a special use, i.e., string concatenation. In Python, we can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings and the `*` operator to repeat strings.

```python
print('hello' + 'world')
print('hello' * 3)
```

Output:

```shell
helloworld
hellohellohello
```

In addition to arithmetic operators, Python also supports comparison operators, including equal `==`, not equal `!=`, greater than `>`, less than `<`, greater than or equal to `>=`, and less than or equal to `<=`. These operators are used to compare the size of two values, and the result is a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.

```python
print(1 == 2)
print(1 != 2)
print(1 > 2)
print(1 < 2)
print(1 >= 2)
print(1 <= 2)
```

Output:

```shell
False
True
False
True
False
True
```

### 1.4 Type Conversion

Sometimes, the data type of a variable is not what we want, and we need to convert the data type of the variable to the desired data type, which may cause some issues.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
a = '1'
b = '2'
print(a + b)
```

::

In the above example, the result of `1 + 2` is `3`, but the result of `a + b` is `12` because the data type of `a` and `b` is string, and the `+` operator concatenates strings. To solve this problem, we need to convert the data type of `a` and `b` to integers.

In Python, we can use the `int()` function to convert an object to an integer, the `float()` function to convert an object to a float, and the `str()` function to convert an object to a string. For the above example, we can convert `a` and `b` to integers and then perform the operation.

```python
a = '1'
b = '2'
print(int(a) + int(b))
```

Output:

```shell
3
```

When performing type conversion, note that if the object cannot be converted to the specified data type, an exception will be raised. For example, if we convert the string `'hello'` to an integer, an exception will be raised.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
a = 'hello'
print(int(a))
```

::

> [!Note]
> Float
>
> A float is a real number with a decimal point. For example, `1.23` and `3.14` are floats. Floats support arithmetic operations like integers, but float operations may have errors because the internal representation of floats in a computer is not precise. For example, the result of `0.1 + 0.2` is not `0.3` but an approximate value. Therefore, when performing operations on floats, we can use the `round()` function to round the result.

```python
a = (2/3)
print(a)
print(round(a))
print(round(a, 2))
```

Output:

```shell
0.6666666666666666
1
0.67
```

### 1.5 Case Study

Having learned the knowledge in this section, you can try to complete the following case study to consolidate your understanding:

[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-1-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-1-1)

Suppose you are writing a simple program to calculate and display the total cost of a shopping list. You need to complete the following tasks:

- Define a string variable `item` to store the name of the item, for example, "apple".
- Define an integer variable `quantity` to store the quantity of the item, for example, 5.
- Define a float variable `price_per_item` to store the price of each item, for example, 2.5 (indicating that each apple costs 2.5 units).
- Use arithmetic operators to calculate the total cost `total_cost`, which is `quantity` multiplied by `price_per_item`.
- Convert `total_cost` to an integer type because you want to display the integer part of the total cost, excluding the decimal part.
- Compare the integer value of `total_cost` to ensure that the quantity purchased does not cause the total cost to exceed 10 units.
- Print the item name, quantity, price per item, and total cost.

Here is another classic case. By observing this case, we can review the knowledge points in this section:

[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-1)

Suppose you are dealing with a simple math problem and need to calculate the perimeter and area of a triangle. The lengths of the three sides of the triangle are a, b, and c, where a, b, and c are integers entered by the user. You need to complete the following tasks:

1. Accept three integers from the user, representing the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
2. Verify whether the input side lengths can form a triangle (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).
3. If a triangle can be formed, calculate the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of the lengths of the three sides).
4. Convert the perimeter to a float and calculate the square root of the perimeter.
5. Convert the integers entered by the user to floats and calculate the average length of the three sides.
6. Use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.

Heron's formula:

$$\text{Area} = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}$$

where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, and \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

## 2. Conditional Statements

In programming, we often need to execute different code based on conditions, which requires conditional statements. The most basic conditional statement in Python is the `if` statement, which is used to determine whether a condition is true. If it is true, the code block in the `if` statement is executed; otherwise, it is not executed.

```python
x = 1
if x > 0:
    print('The number is positive.')
```

Output:

```shell
The number is positive.
```

In the above example, we use the `input()` function to receive an integer input from the user and then determine whether the integer is greater than 0. If it is greater than 0, it outputs `The number is positive.`. Now, let's look at a more complex example to determine whether an integer is positive, negative, or zero.

```python
x = int(input('Please enter an integer: '))
if x > 0:
    print('The number is positive.')
if x < 0:
    print('The number is negative.')
if x == 0:
    print('The number is zero.')
```

Output:

```shell
Please enter an integer:
# User enters 5
The number is positive.
```

In the above example, we use three `if` statements to determine whether the integer `x` is greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to 0. Although this meets our needs, the code is redundant because an integer cannot be both greater than 0 and less than 0. To solve this problem, we can use the `if-elif` statement. `elif` is short for `else if` and is used to determine multiple conditions.

```python
x = int(input('Please enter an integer: '))
if x > 0:
    print('The number is positive.')
elif x < 0:
    print('The number is negative.')
elif x == 0:
    print('The number is zero.')
```

Output:

```shell
Please enter an integer:
# User enters -5
The number is negative.
```

In the `if-elif` statement, when the first condition is true, the corresponding code block is executed, and the entire `if-elif` statement is exited, without executing the subsequent conditions. If the first condition is false, the next condition is checked until a true condition is found, and the corresponding code block is executed. If all conditions are false, no code block is executed. If multiple conditions are true, only the code block of the first true condition is executed.

For the above example, we also find that there is no need to perform the third check because when the integer `x` is greater than 0, it cannot be less than 0 or equal to 0. To further simplify the code, we can use the `if-elif-else` statement. `else` is used to handle all other cases.

```python
x = int(input('Please enter an integer: '))
if x > 0:
    print('The number is positive.')
elif x < 0:
    print('The number is negative.')
else:
    print('The number is zero.')
```

Output:

```shell
Please enter an integer:
# User enters 0
The number is zero.
```

From the above example, we can summarize the following rules:

- The `if` statement is used to determine whether a condition is true. If it is true, the code block in the `if` statement is executed.
- There can be multiple `elif` statements to determine multiple conditions.
- If all conditions are false, the `else` statement can be used to execute the code block in the `else` statement.
- If each condition to be checked is unrelated, multiple `if` statements can be used; if the conditions are mutually exclusive, the `if-elif-else` statement can be used.

### 2.1 Case Study

Next, let’s complete another exercise: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-2-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-2-1)

In this exercise, you will write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year. The rules for determining a leap year are as follows:

1. If the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
2. If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Accept a year input from the user.
2. Determine if the year is a leap year.
3. Output the result.

## 3. Logical Operators

In conditional statements, we often need to determine multiple conditions, which requires logical operators. Python has three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. These operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

Semantically, `and` means "and", `or` means "or", and `not` means "not". Logical operators are usually used in conditional statements to determine multiple conditions.

- `and` operator: The result is true if both conditions are true; otherwise, it is false.
- `or` operator: The result is true if at least one of the conditions is true; otherwise, it is false.
- `not` operator: The result is false if the condition is true; the result is true if the condition is false.

![Logical Operators in Python](http://szms-python-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Python%20Basics/%E6%96%B0%E7%89%88%E8%84%91%E5%9B%BE/%E9%80%BB%E8%BE%91%E8%BF%90%E7%AE%97%E7%AC%A6en.png)

Let's look at an example to determine whether an integer is greater than 0 and less than 10.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
x = 5
if x > 0 and x < 10:
    print('The number is between 0 and 10.')
else:
    print('The number is not between 0 and 10.')
```

::

Here, we use the `and` operator to combine two conditions. Only when both conditions are true is the result true. If `x` does not satisfy either of these conditions, the code block in the `else` statement is executed.

Let's slightly modify the above example to determine whether an integer is less than 0 or greater than 10.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
x = 5
if x < 0 or x > 10:
    print('The number is less than 0 or greater than 10.')
else:
    print('The number is between 0 and 10.')
```

::

Here, we use the `or` operator to combine two conditions. As long as at least one of the conditions is true, the result is true. If `x` satisfies either of these conditions, the code block in the `if` statement is executed.

Finally, let's look at an example using the `not` operator to determine whether an integer is not equal to 0.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
x = 5
if not x == 0:
    print('The number is not zero.')
else:
    print('The number is zero.')
```

::

Here, we use the `not` operator to negate the condition, i.e., when the condition is true, the result is false; when the condition is false, the result is true. If `x` is not equal to 0, the code block in the `if` statement is executed; otherwise, the code block in the `else` statement is executed.

The precedence of these operators is `not` > `and` > `or`. If there are multiple logical operators, parentheses `()` can be used to change the order of operations.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
x = -5
y = 10
z = 5

# Without parentheses
if x > 0 and y > 0 or z > 0:
    print('Condition without parentheses is True.')
else:
    print('Condition without parentheses is False.')

# With parentheses
if x > 0 and (y > 0 or z > 0):
    print('Condition with parentheses is True.')
else:
    print('Condition with parentheses is False.')
```

::

In the above example, we use `and` and `or` operators to combine multiple conditions:

- Without parentheses: Since `and` has a higher precedence than `or`, `x > 0 and y > 0` is evaluated first, resulting in False. Then `False or z > 0` is evaluated, and since `z > 0` is True, the entire condition is True.
- With parentheses: The condition inside the parentheses is evaluated first, i.e., `y > 0 or z > 0`, which is True. Then `x > 0 and True` is evaluated, resulting in False. So the entire condition is False.

### 3.1 Case Study

Next there is a simple exercise through which you can consolidate your knowledge of logical operators: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-3-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-3-1)

Write a program that simulates a bank account management system. The system needs to check whether the user has enough balance to withdraw money and whether the withdrawal amount is legal. The specific requirements are as follows:

1. The user's account balance must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. The withdrawal amount must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the account balance.
3. The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10.

Only when the user meets all the above conditions can the withdrawal be successful.
