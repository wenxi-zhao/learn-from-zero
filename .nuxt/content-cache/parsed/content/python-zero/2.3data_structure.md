When we need to store multiple pieces of data, a good way is to use data structures. Python has four basic data structures: lists (`list`), tuples (`tuple`), sets (`set`), and dictionaries (`dict`). They have two basic properties: whether they are ordered and whether they are mutable. Ordered means that the elements in the data structure are arranged in a certain order, and each object has a clear position. For ordered data structures, we can refer to the objects as the first, second, third, etc. Mutable means that the elements in the data structure can be modified. If they can be modified, we call the data structure mutable; if not, we call it immutable.

![Data Structures in Python](http://szms-python-images.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/Python%20Basics/%E6%96%B0%E7%89%88%E8%84%91%E5%9B%BE/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84en.png)

Typically, we use lists to store multiple elements, tuples to store multiple immutable elements, sets to store multiple unique elements, and dictionaries to store multiple key-value pairs.

## 1. Lists

Lists are the most commonly used data structure in Python, used to store multiple ordered elements. Lists are represented by square brackets `[]`, with elements separated by commas `,`. The elements in a list can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and even other lists.

> [!Note]
> Although lists support storing elements of different types, it is generally not recommended to store different types of elements in a list, as it makes the code difficult to understand.

Here is a simple example of a list.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
print(type(numbers))
print()
my_list = [1, 2.3, 'hello', True, [1, 2, 3]]
print(my_list)
print(type(my_list))
```

::

Since lists are an ordered data structure, we can use indexing to access elements in the list. In Python, indexing starts from 0, i.e., the index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on. Additionally, we can use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the list, i.e., the index of the last element is -1, the index of the second last element is -2, and so on.

To use indexing, add square brackets `[]` after the list name and fill in the index value, i.e., `list[index]`.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[1])
print(my_list[-1])
```

Output:

```shell
apple
banana
elderberry
```

In Python, we can also use slicing to access multiple elements in a list. To use slicing, add square brackets `[]` after the list name and fill in the start index, end index, and step (step defaults to 1 and can be omitted), separated by colons `:`, i.e., `list[start:end:step]`. Slicing returns a new list containing all elements from the start index to the end index, but not including the end index.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
print(my_list[1:3])
print(my_list[:3])
print(my_list[3:])
print(my_list[1:4:2])
```

Output:

```shell
['banana', 'cherry']
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
['date', 'elderberry']
['banana', 'date']
```

Additionally, since lists are mutable, we can modify elements in the list using indexing and assignment statements, i.e., `list[index] = value`.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
my_list[1] = 'blueberry'
print(my_list)
```

Output:

```shell
['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
```

By flexibly using list indexing, we can swap two elements in a list.

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
my_list[1], my_list[2] = my_list[2], my_list[1]
print(my_list)
```

Output:

```shell
['apple', 'cherry', 'banana', 'date', 'elderberry']
```

Additionally, we can use the `append()` method to add new elements to the list and the `remove()` method to remove specified elements.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
my_list.append('fig')
print(my_list)
my_list.remove('banana')
print(my_list)
```

::

## 2. Tuples

Tuples are another ordered data structure in Python. The biggest difference from lists is that tuples are immutable, i.e., the elements in a tuple cannot be modified. Tuples are represented by parentheses `()`, with elements separated by commas `,`.

The usage of tuples is similar to lists. We can use indexing and slicing to access elements in a tuple, but we cannot modify the elements in a tuple.

Here is a simple example of a tuple.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)
print(type(my_tuple))
```

::

Similar to lists, we can use indexing and slicing to access elements in a tuple.

```python
my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry')
print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple[1])
print(my_tuple[-1])
print(my_tuple[1:3])
```

Output:

```shell
apple
banana
elderberry
('banana', 'cherry')
```

However, we cannot modify elements in a tuple, otherwise an exception will be raised.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_tuple = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry')
my_tuple[1] = 'blueberry'
```

::

> [!Note]
> In Python, strings can be considered a special type of tuple, i.e., strings are immutable ordered sequences. Therefore, strings also support indexing and slicing operations, but characters in a string cannot be modified.

```python
my_string = 'hello'
print(my_string[0])
print(my_string[1:3])
```

Output:

```shell
h
el
```

## 3. Sets

Sets are an unordered data structure in Python, used to store multiple unique elements. Sets are represented by curly braces `{}`, with elements separated by commas `,`.

An important feature of sets is that the elements in a set are unique, i.e., duplicate elements are not allowed in a set.

Here is a simple example of a set.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)
print(type(my_set))
```

::

Unlike lists and tuples, sets are unordered, so we cannot use indexing and slicing to access elements in a set. However, we can use the `in` operator to check if an element is in the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(1 in my_set)
print(6 in my_set)
```

Output:

```shell
True
False
```

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set[0])
```

::

We can use the `add()` method to add new elements to the set and the `remove()` method to remove specified elements.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)
my_set.remove(6)
print(my_set)
```

::

Since the elements in a set are unique, adding duplicate elements to the set will have no effect.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)
my_set.add(6)
print(my_set)
```

Output:

```shell
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
```

As you can see, adding the element `6` a second time does not add a new element to the set because the set already contains the element `6`.

We can use the characteristics of sets to remove duplicates from a list, i.e., remove duplicate elements from a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_set = set(my_list)
print(my_set)
```

Output:

```shell
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

> [!Note]
> You may have noticed that lists, tuples, and sets can be converted to each other, i.e., we can use the `list()`, `tuple()`, and `set()` functions to convert a list, tuple, or set to another list, tuple, or set. However, note that the converted data structure may lose some information. For example, sets are unordered, so converting to a list or tuple may change the order of elements and lose duplicate elements.

Additionally, we can use the `union()` method to find the union of two sets, the `intersection()` method to find the intersection of two sets, and the `difference()` method to find the difference between two sets.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1.intersection(set2))
print(set1.difference(set2))
```

## 4. Dictionaries

Dictionaries are an unordered data structure in Python used to store multiple key-value pairs. Dictionaries are represented by curly braces `{}`, with each key-value pair separated by a colon `:`, and key-value pairs separated by commas `,`.

You can imagine a scenario where you have an English-Chinese dictionary, and you can look up the Chinese meaning by the English word. In this scenario, the English word is the key, and the Chinese meaning is the value. This is the basic structure of a dictionary.

To further understand the concept of key-value pairs, consider the following table:

| Key   | Value                |
|-------|----------------------|
| name  | Alice, Bob, Charlie  |
| age   | 18, 19, 20           |

In this example, `name` and `age` are keys, and `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, `18`, `19`, and `20` are values. A key-value pair is an element in a dictionary, and a dictionary can have multiple key-value pairs.

Let's look at a simple scenario where we represent the following table using Python data structures:

| Hermione | Harry | Ron | Draco |
|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| Gryffindor | Gryffindor | Gryffindor | Slytherin |

Suppose we first use lists to represent this table, we can do it like this:

```python
students = ['Hermione', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Draco']
houses = ['Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Slytherin']
```

We can see that using lists to represent this table can represent the content of the table, but it cannot represent the relationships in the table, i.e., it cannot show that Hermione corresponds to Gryffindor, Harry corresponds to Gryffindor, etc. We can only use indexes to find the corresponding values. This requires us to remember the index of each student to find the corresponding house. When there are many students, this method becomes very cumbersome.

To solve this problem, we can use dictionaries to represent this table, so we can look up the corresponding house by the student's name.

```python
students = {
    'Hermione': 'Gryffindor',
    'Harry': 'Gryffindor',
    'Ron': 'Gryffindor',
    'Draco': 'Slytherin'
}

print(students['Hermione'])
print(students['Harry'])
print(students['Ron'])
print(students['Draco'])
```

Output:

```shell
Gryffindor
Gryffindor
Gryffindor
Slytherin
```

In this example, `students` is a dictionary, `'Hermione'`, `'Harry'`, `'Ron'`, and `'Draco'` are keys, and `'Gryffindor'`, `'Gryffindor'`, `'Gryffindor'`, and `'Slytherin'` are values. Using a dictionary, we can look up the corresponding house by the student's name.

Since dictionaries are unordered, we cannot use indexing and slicing to access elements in a dictionary. However, as we see in the example above, we can use keys to access values in a dictionary. Therefore, keys in a dictionary are unique and cannot be duplicated. However, values can be duplicated, i.e., values in a dictionary can be repeated.

Here is a simple example of a dictionary.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18}
print(my_dict)
print(type(my_dict))
```

::

In addition to directly creating dictionaries, we can also use the `dict()` function to initialize an empty dictionary and then add elements using key-value pairs.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_dict = dict()
my_dict['name'] = 'Alice'
my_dict['age'] = 18
print(my_dict)
```

::

Additionally, since dictionaries are mutable, we can modify values in a dictionary by accessing keys and using assignment statements to assign new values to elements in the dictionary, i.e., `dict[key] = value`.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18}
my_dict['age'] = 19
print(my_dict)
```

::

We can use the `keys()` method to get all keys in a dictionary, the `values()` method to get all values in a dictionary, and the `items()` method to get all key-value pairs in a dictionary.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18}
print(my_dict.keys())
print(my_dict.values())
print(my_dict.items())
```

::

The keys and values in a dictionary do not have to be of the same data type. Keys can be any immutable data type, such as integers, floats, strings, tuples, and values can be any data type, such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.

```python
my_dict = {1: 'Alice', 2.3: 18, 'name': 'Alice', (1, 2): [1, 2], 'info': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18}} 
print(my_dict[1])
print(my_dict[2.3])
print(my_dict['name'])
print(my_dict[(1, 2)])
print(my_dict[(1, 2)][0])
print(my_dict['info'])
```

Output:

```shell
Alice
18
Alice
[1, 2]
1
{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18}
```

If we have more complex data, we can combine lists and dictionaries. For example, we can use dictionaries to represent information about a student, including name, age, and score, and then store information about multiple students in a list.

```python
students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 18, 'score': 90},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 19, 'score': 85},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 20, 'score': 80}
]
print(students[0]['name'])
print(students[1]['age'])
print(students[2]['score'])
```

Output:

```shell
Alice
19
80
```

Note how we access each student's information. First, we access the student list by index, and at this point, we get a dictionary of a student. Then, we access the student's information by key.

## 5. Case Study

Next there is a simple exercise through which you can consolidate your knowledge of data structures:[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-4-1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zhaowenxi/python-basics-4-1)

In this exercise, you will write a program to manage student grades. You need to complete the following tasks:

- Create a list containing information about multiple students, with each student's information including name, age, and score.
- Calculate and output the average score of all students.
- Find and output the student with the highest score and their score.
- Find and output the student with the lowest score and their score.

The student information form is as follows:

| Name    | Age | Score |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Alice   | 18  | 90    |
| Bob     | 19  | 85    |
| Charlie | 20  | 80    |
| David    | 21   | 95   |
| Eve      | 22   | 88   |
