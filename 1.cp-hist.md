Nuxt is a free and [open-source framework](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

## 代码块测试

### 可运行python

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
  ```python
  print("hi")
  ```
::

### 代码组有切换按钮

::code-group
  ```python [main1.py] noTag
  import pandas as pd
  print("hi1")
  ```
  ```python [main2.py] noTag
  import pandas as pd
  print("hi2")
  ```
  ::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" label="编辑"}
  ```python
  print("hi")
  ```
  ::
  ::preview-card{label="Preview"}
  Default slot text
  #description
  This will be rendered inside the `description` slot.
  ::
::

### 无路径代码

```python
import pandas as pd
print("hi")
```

### 有路径代码

```js [file.js]{4-6,7} meta-info=val
export default () => {
  console.log('Code block')
}
```



## Server-Side Rendering

Nuxt comes with built-in server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities by default, without having to configure a server yourself, which has many benefits for web applications:

- **Faster initial page load time:** Nuxt sends a fully rendered HTML page to the browser, which can be displayed immediately. This can provide a faster perceived page load time and a better user experience (UX), especially on slower networks or devices.
- **Improved SEO:** search engines can better index SSR pages because the HTML content is available immediately, rather than requiring JavaScript to render the content on the client-side.

As Nuxt is a versatile framework, it gives you the possibility to statically render your whole application to a static hosting with `nuxt generate`,
disable SSR globally with the `ssr: false` option or leverage hybrid rendering by setting up the `routeRules` option.

Nuxt takes care of these and provides both frontend and backend functionality so you can focus on what matters: **creating your web application**.

### Architecture

Nuxt is composed of different [core packages](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/tree/main/packages):

- Core Engine: [nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/tree/main/packages/nuxt)
- Bundlers: [@nuxt/vite-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/tree/main/packages/vite) and [@nuxt/webpack-builder](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/tree/main/packages/webpack)

We recommend reading each concept to have a full vision of Nuxt capabilities and the scope of each package.
