As we mentioned earlier, Python is excellent for data processing, so we'll provide an overview of Python's built-in data structures and libraries from a data manipulation perspective. But as the saying goes, "sharpening your axe won't delay your woodcutting," so before we start learning, we must have a good "tool" at hand. It's highly recommended that everyone install Anaconda. You can install it from the following link [Anaconda China Mirror](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/)

And it's highly recommended that everyone manually types the code in IPython or Jupyter during the exploration learning process, and follows the examples to experiment and try different things.

## 2.1 Running the First Command

Python is an interpreted language. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing each line of the program. The standard interactive Python interpreter can be invoked using the `python` command in the terminal:

```
$ python
Python 3.10.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Mar 24 2022, 17:38:57)
[GCC 10.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = 5
>>> print(a)
5

```

You see the `>>>` is the _prompt_ where you will input the code expression. To exit the Python interpreter, you can input `exit()` or press Ctrl-D (only for Linux and macOS).

Running a Python program is as simple as calling `python` and passing the _.py_ file as the first argument. Suppose we have created a _hello_world.py_ file containing the following:

```
print("Hello world")

```

You can run it by executing the following command (the _hello_world.py_ file must be in your current working terminal directory):

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  print("Hello world")
```

::

## 2.2 IPython Basics

In this section, I will quickly introduce you to the IPython shell and Jupyter notebooks, and introduce some basic concepts.

### Running IPython Shell

You can start the IPython shell in the terminal just like starting a regular Python interpreter, using the `ipython` command:

```
$ ipython
Python 3.10.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Mar 24 2022, 17:38:57)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.31.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: a = 5

In [2]: a
Out[2]: 5

```

You can execute any Python statement by typing the Python statement and pressing Enter (or Enter key). When you only input a variable, IPython will present the object's string representation:

```
In [5]: import numpy as np

In [6]: data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]

In [7]: data
Out[7]:
[-0.20470765948471295,
 0.47894333805754824,
 -0.5194387150567381,
 -0.55573030434749,
 1.9657805725027142,
 1.3934058329729904,
 0.09290787674371767]

```

The first two lines are Python code statements; the second statement creates a variable named `data` pointing to a newly created list. The last line prints the value of `data` to the console.

Many kinds of Python objects are formatted for readability or _pretty printing_, which is different from normal printing using `print`. If you print the above `data` variable in a standard Python interpreter, it will be less readable:

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]
>>> print(data)
>>> data
[-0.5767699931966723, -0.1010317773535111, -1.7841005313329152,
-1.524392126408841, 0.22191374220117385, -1.9835710588082562,
-1.6081963964963528]

```

### 2.3 Running Jupyter Notebook in the Terminal

One of the main components of the Jupyter project is the _notebook_, an interactive document for code, text (including Markdown), data visualizations, and other outputs. Jupyter notebooks interact with _kernels_, which are implementations of the Jupyter interactive computing protocol for different programming languages. The Python Jupyter kernel uses the IPython system as its underlying behavior.

To start Jupyter, run the `jupyter` `notebook` command in the terminal:

```
$ jupyter notebook
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory:
/home/wesm/code/pydata-book
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4bb443a63f2d...
[I 15:20:52.740 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down
all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
Created new window in existing browser session.
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/wesm/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-185259-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4...
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4...

```

On many platforms, Jupyter will automatically open in your default web browser (unless you start with `--no-browser`). Otherwise, you can navigate to the HTTP address printed when you started the notebook, such as `http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4bb443a63f2d3055`

![Jupyter Notebook Homepage](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/200aaf1140ee7ca4bfeea2d34e01bec7.png)

To create a new notebook, click the "New" button and select the "Python 3" option. As shown in the figure above. If this is your first time trying it, try clicking on the empty "cell" and entering a single line of Python code. Then press Shift-Enter to execute it.

### Built-in Search

Using the question mark (`?`) before or after a variable will display some general information about the object:

```
In [1]: b = [1, 2, 3]

In [2]: b?
Type:        list
String form: [1, 2, 3]
Length:      3
Docstring:
Built-in mutable sequence.

If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
The argument must be an iterable if specified.

In [3]: print?
Docstring:
print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
Type:      builtin_function_or_method

```

This is called _object introspection_. If the object is a function or instance method, it will also display if a docstring is defined. Suppose we wrote the following function (you can reproduce it in IPython or Jupyter):

```
def add_numbers(a, b):
 """
 Add two numbers together

 Returns
 -------
 the_sum : type of arguments
 """
 return a + b

```

Then use ? to display the docstring:

```
In [6]: add_numbers?
Signature: add_numbers(a, b)
Docstring:
Add two numbers together
Returns
-------
the_sum : type of arguments
File:      <ipython-input-9-6a548a216e27>
Type:      function

```

### Installing Python Libraries in Pyodide

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
<<<<<<< HEAD
```python
  import pyodide_js
  await pyodide_js.loadPackage("micropip")

  import micropip
  await micropip.install("numpy")
```
=======

```python
    import pyodide_js
    await pyodide_js.loadPackage("micropip")

    import micropip
    await micropip.install("numpy")
```

>>>>>>> 8254bcc34b16895dfbf1261430415f0cc83142fc
::

### Indentation

Python uses spaces to represent indentation to structure your code. Especially in `define` or `for loop` statements,

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
<<<<<<< HEAD
```python
=======

````python
>>>>>>> 8254bcc34b16895dfbf1261430415f0cc83142fc
  import micropip
  await micropip.install('numpy')

  import numpy as np
  # Create NumPy array
  array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  # Choose pivot
  pivot = 3
  # Create two lists to store elements less than pivot and greater than or equal to pivot
  less = []
  greater = []

  for x in array:
    if x < pivot:
      less.append(x)
    else:
      greater.append(x)
  print("Elements less than pivot:", less)
  print("Elements greater than or equal to pivot:", greater)
```
::



Colon (`:`) indicates the start of a code block, and all code within the block must be indented by the same amount until the block ends. Four spaces are generally used as the default indentation. You will find that when you type `:` and press Enter, Jupyter will automatically indent for you.

### Comments

Any text preceded by a hash (`#`) will be ignored by the Python interpreter. This is often used to add comments to the code. Sometimes you may also want to exclude certain code blocks without deleting them. One solution is to *comment out* the code:
The second method is to use `"""` or `'''` to comment multiple lines of code.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
  ```python
  # This is a simple calculator function
  def calculator(a, b, operation):
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations.

    Parameters:
    a (float): The first number
    b (float): The second number
    operation (str): Type of operation ('+', '-', '*', '/')

    Returns:
    float: The result of the calculation
    """
    if operation == '+':
        return a + b
    elif operation == '-':
        return a - b
    elif operation == '*':
        return a * b
    elif operation == '/':
        # TODO: Add error handling for division by zero
        return a / b
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")

  # Test the calculator function
  print(calculator(5, 3, '+'))  # Should output 8
  print(calculator(10, 2, '*'))  # Should output 20

  # print(calculator(10, 0, '/'))  # This line would cause an error, temporarily commented out
````

This will skip the commented parts and run the code below. Comments are very useful and a good habit, both to help you review later and to make it easier for others to understand your code.

### Variables and Parameter Passing

In Python, we use `=` to create variables and assign values, as follows:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  a
```

::

Here, variable `a` is an integer list, and suppose we assign `a` to a new variable `b`:

In Python, `a` and `b` now point to the same object, which is the original list `[1, 2, 3]`. You can prove this by appending an element to `a` and then checking `b`:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a
  a.append(4)
  print("a =", a)
  print("b =", b)
```

### Binary Operators

| Operation     | Description                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a + b         | Add a and b                                                                   |
| a - b         | Subtract b from a                                                             |
| a\* b         | Multiply a by b                                                               |
| a / b         | Divide a by b                                                                 |
| a // b        | Floor division by b, removing any decimal remainder                           |
| a\*\* b       | Raise a to the power of b                                                     |
| a & b         | True if both a and b are True; for integers, bitwise AND                      |
| a ^ b         | For booleans, True if a or b is True, but not both; for integers, bitwise XOR |
| a == b        | True if a equals b                                                            |
| a != b        | True if a is not equal to b                                                   |
| a < b, a <= b | True if a is less than (less than or equal to) b                              |
| a > b, a >= b | True if a is greater than (greater than or equal to) b                        |
| a is b        | True if a and b refer to the same Python object                               |
| a is not b    | True if a and b refer to different Python objects                             |

The table above shows some simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparisons, etc., which are often used in logical judgments.

### Data Types

In Python, there are the following data types:

- Integer (int)
- Float (float)
- String (str)
- Boolean (bool)
- List (list)
- Tuple (tuple)
- Dictionary (dict)
- Set (set)
- Date and Time (datetime)

### Dictionary

A dictionary is another important data type in Python that allows us to store key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`, with each key-value pair separated by a colon `:`, and different pairs separated by commas `,`.

Let's understand dictionaries through a practical example:

Suppose we want to record a student's basic information:

```python
student = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 20,
    "grades": [85, 92, 78],
    "is_active": True
}
```

This example demonstrates several important features of dictionaries:

- Keys must be unique
- Values can be of any data type (strings, numbers, lists, booleans, etc.)
- Dictionaries are mutable, meaning we can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs

#### Common Dictionary Operations

```python
# Accessing values
print(student["name"])  # Output: John

# Modifying values
student["age"] = 21

# Adding new key-value pairs
student["class"] = "Python Class"

# Deleting key-value pairs
del student["is_active"]

# Getting all keys
print(student.keys())

# Getting all values
print(student.values())
```

> 💡 **Real-world Application Example**
> In real development, dictionaries are frequently used for handling configuration information, API response data, or database query results. For example, product information in an e-commerce system can be represented using a dictionary:

```python
product = {
    "id": "P001",
    "name": "Mechanical Keyboard",
    "price": 299.99,
    "stock": 50,
    "specifications": {
        "brand": "Cherry",
        "type": "Mechanical Switch",
        "color": "Black"
    }
}
```

### Exercise: School Grade Calculator

**Description:**  
Create a simple grade calculator that stores student scores and calculates their average using operators and a dictionary.

**Solution:**

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
```python
# Create a dictionary to store student scores
student_scores = {
    "Math": 85,
    "Science": 92,
    "English": 78,
    "History": 95
}

# Calculate total score using operators
total_score = student_scores["Math"] + student_scores["Science"] + \
              student_scores["English"] + student_scores["History"]

# Calculate average score using division operator
number_of_subjects = len(student_scores)
average_score = total_score / number_of_subjects

# Print results
print("Individual Scores:", student_scores)
print("Total Score:", total_score)
print("Average Score:", average_score)

# Check if the student passed (average > 80)
passed = average_score > 80
print("Student Passed:", passed)
```
::

**Key Concepts:**

1. Dictionary Creation: Using `{}` to create a dictionary with subjects and scores
2. Arithmetic Operators: `+` for addition, `/` for division
3. Dictionary Access: Using `dict["key"]` to get values
4. Comparison Operator: `>` to check if average is above passing grade

> :bulb: **Tip:** Think of a dictionary like a student's report card - each subject (key) has its corresponding score (value)!

### 练习题：四大名著作者查询系统

**题目描述：**
请创建一个字典来存储四大名著及其作者信息，然后编写代码实现查询功能。

**参考解答：**

```python
# 创建存储四大名著信息的字典
famous_novels = {
    "水浒传": "施耐庵",
    "三国演义": "罗贯中",
    "西游记": "吴承恩",
    "红楼梦": "曹雪芹"
}

# 查询示例
def query_author(book_name):
    if book_name in famous_novels:
        return f"{book_name}的作者是：{famous_novels[book_name]}"
    else:
        return "未找到该书籍信息"

# 测试代码
print(query_author("西游记"))  # 输出：西游记的作者是：吴承恩
print(query_author("水浒传"))  # 输出：水浒传的作者是：施耐庵
print(query_author("聊斋志异"))  # 输出：未找到该书籍信息
```

**知识点解释：**

1. 字典的创建：使用 `{}` 创建字典，键是书名，值是作者名
2. 字典的查询：使用 `in` 关键字检查键是否存在
3. 字典的访问：使用 `dict[key]` 获取对应的值
